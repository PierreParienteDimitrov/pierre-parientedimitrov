    <p>
      I started my career in San Francisco, as a Strategic Analyst for a major
      international bank. I learned there how to conduct Market Research and
      User Interviews. This lead me to the world of UX/UI Design.

      After multiple online trainings and many hours working of different
      projects, I started a new chapter of my career as a Product Designer. Over
      the last five years, I have conceptualised, designed and built Mobile
      Applications, Websites and Web App for a wide range of industries.

      In 2020, at the start of the pandemic, I started a Full-Stack Web
      Development Bootcamp with UCLA. I have since then refined my engineering
      skills and worked on multiple web-based projects.
