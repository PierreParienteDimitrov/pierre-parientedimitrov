          <h5>
            As the sole UX/UI designer and researcher, my goal was to create a
            user-centered design for Tempso by spending extra time with
            researching and iterating designs based on usability testings. Thus,
            the process was divided into the following steps:

            <h5>
              I spent a full month conducting user research with musicians,
              classical music amateurs and music streaming users through
              interviews to understand user‚Äôs experience with classical music
              streaming. I also reviewed secondary research and user comments
              about existing solutions for classical music streaming on forums
              and blogs.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              My hypothesis was that a majority of users would listen to
              classical music only if they were already very familiar with the
              genre, but I was surprised to find in my research that over half
              of potential users did not have a strong relationship to classical
              music and were curious to discover it. The largest complaint found
              in research was that users, both classical music specialists and
              non-specialists, didn‚Äôt know how to find classical music
              recordings or where to start.

                Classical music specialists who didn‚Äôt stream classical music
                said their reasoning was that they could never get a clear
                picture of what recording they were listening too. ‚ÄúWhy is the
                composer tagged as a performer? Why can‚Äôt I find the complete
                list of performers for this recording?‚Äù were common comments
                addressed to mainstream music streaming platforms. I decided to
                change this by building a complete classical music data
                architecture which would guide the design process.

              My biggest takeaway from research was that users wanted different
              type of experience for a classical music streaming app.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              Musicians and experimented classical music listeners wanted the
              ability to deep dive into the catalogue, explore performer‚Äôs
              discographies, composer‚Äôs catalogues, compare recordings, explore
              genres. This category of users wanted to be allowed to explore the
              catalogue through different data points, but did not need
              suggestions and recommendations on what to listen to.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              First-time listeners wanted to know where to start and what to
              listen to. They are not independent listeners and need help to
              turn on the music.
            </h5>
            <h5>
              To answer bot of those needs, I decided to list desired actions
              for both personas and build user journey:

              <h5>
                In order to answer Cecilia&apos;s needs, I created a first flow
                chart that detailed all the required steps that a user must take
                to compare recordings of the same composition.
              </h5>
              <h5>
                This flow chart showed that users would have to undertake a lot
                of different steps in order to be able to compare recordings.
                User Research showed, however, that this feature was appreciated
                equally by all Personas. In addition, it seemed like a
                differentiator for Tempso.
              </h5>
              <h5>
                This is why I decided to have a &quot;Compare&quot; tab, in the
                bottom navigation. This tab is refreshed with the current
                composition that the user is listening to. This helps any user
                compare recordings easily and &quot;hammers&quot; Tempso&apos;s
                value proposition; but also demonstrates the uniqueness of
                classical music.

                Create two Recording Component: one for all playlists, albums,
                radios; and another one specifically for the Compare page, which
                would focus the user on the performers only. Since the compare
                page would display as a title the composer name, era, and
                composition title, it felt unecessary to repeat this information
                for each recordings.
